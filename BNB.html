                <h2 class="move-headers">About Binance Coin (BNB)</h2>
                <p class="move-right-up">
                    Binance Coin (BNB) is a cryptocurrency that can be used to trade and pay fees on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. The Binance Exchange is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world as of January 2018, facilitating more than 1.4 million transactions per second.
                    Users of Binance Coin receive a discount in transaction fees on the Binance Exchange as an incentive. BNB can also be exchanged or traded for other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc.

                    Binance Coin was created in July 2017 and initially worked on the ethereum blockchain with the token ERC-20 before it became the native currency of Binance’s own blockchain, the Binance Chain.

                <p class="move-right-up">
                    Binance coin initially ran on the Ethereum blockchain with ERC 20 standard but has since become the native coin of the Binance chain. It was launched during an initial coin offering (ICO) in July 2017 and has a strict maximum of 200 million BNB tokens. It offered 10%, or 20 million, BNB tokens to angel investors, 40%, or 80 million, tokens to the founding team, and the remaining 50%, or 100 million, to the various participants through the ICO process.

                    Almost half the funds raised during the ICO process were intended to be used for Binance branding and marketing, while around one-third were used to build the Binance platform and perform necessary upgrades to the Binance ecosystem.

                    BNB was initially based on the Ethereum network but is now the native currency of Binance's own blockchain, the Binance chain.

                <h3 class="move-headers"><b>Binance Coin Burning</b></h3>
                <p class="move-right">
                    Although 100 million Binance tokens were initially offered in the ICO, the current total supply is lower. Every quarter, Binance uses one-fifth of its profits to repurchase and permanently destroy, or "burn," Binance coins held in its treasury.

                    Binance has regularly performed these burning events. The latest BNB burn came on April 15, 2021, when Binance burned a total of 1,099,888 BNB, equivalent to $595,314,380 USD worth of tokens. It is Binance's 15th quarterly BNB burn and its largest ever in terms of U.S. dollars. The total supply of BNB has decreased from 170,532,825 to 169,432,937.

                <h3 class="move-headers">BNB pricing and dynamics</h3>
                <p class="move-left">
                    In general, BNB’s price has historically fluctuated in a fashion similar to other crypto assets trading on the market. Binance Coin’s market cap has grown over the years, surpassing a valuation of $70 billion. During Binance’s ICO, BNB sold for about $0.10 per token.

                    Since Binance’s ICO, BNB has traded its way up in value significantly, fetching a price tag of more than $600 per coin at times. Is Binance Coin a good investment? Its historical price rise likely yielded profit if buyers entered and sold at the right times. Although going forward, only the future will reveal where BNB’s price will head.

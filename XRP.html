                <h2>About Ripple (XRP)</h2>
                <p>
                    XRP is the native cryptocurrency for products developed by Ripple Labs. Its products are used for payment settlement, asset exchange, and remittance systems that work more like SWIFT, a service for international money and security transfers used by a network of banks and financial intermediaries.3 XRP is pre-mined and uses a less complicated method of mining as compared to Bitcoin.
                </p>

                <h3>What Is XRP?</h3>
                <p>
                    XRP is a digital asset built for payments. It is the native digital asset on the XRP Ledger—an open-source, permissionless and decentralized blockchain technology that can settle transactions in 3-5 seconds.

                    XRP can be sent directly without needing a central intermediary, making it a convenient instrument in bridging two different currencies quickly and efficiently.
                </p>

                <h3>How Is XRP Used?</h3>
                <p>
                    Faster, less costly and more scalable than any other digital asset, XRP and the XRP Ledger are used to power innovative technology across the payments space.

                    Ripple is focused on building technology to help unleash new utility for XRP and transform global payments. Third parties are also pursuing other XRP-related use cases.

                <h3>XRP Is Cheaper and Faster than Bitcoin</h3>
                <p>
                    Due to the complicated and intensive nature of mining used in the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin transaction confirmations may take many minutes and are associated with high transaction costs. XRP transactions are confirmed within seconds and generally occur at very low costs.

                    Similar to the bitcoin transaction processing fee, XRP transactions are charged. Each time a transaction is performed on the Ripple network, a small amount of XRP is charged to the user (individual or organization).

                <h3>When was XRP founded?</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2012, three years after Bitcoin ushered in the cryptocurrency era, Ripple changed tracks and became OpenCoin—a network for money transfers where large businesses and financial services firms acted as counterparties to transactions.

                    XRP, its cryptocurrency, was launched in the same year with 80 billion tokens going to the company and 20 billion to its co-founders. The purpose of XRP was to serve as an intermediate mechanism of exchange between two currencies or networks. OpenCoin became Ripple Labs in September 2013.

                <h3>How to Buy XRP?</h3>
                <p>
                    Like other cryptocurrencies, XRP is available through several online exchanges. You can buy XRP with fiat currency or cryptocurrency. Ripple's XRP Ledger platform additionally supports a decentralized exchange that enables XRP trading directly with peers.
